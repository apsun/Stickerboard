    <h1>Welcome to Stickerboard!</h1>
    <p>
        Before we get started, there's a few steps you'll need to take in order to use
        Stickerboard:
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <br><h1>Enable the keyboard</h1>
    <p>
        Please enable Stickerboard by heading to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Settings</li>
        <li>Stickerboard</li>
        <li>Keyboards</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        <a href=\"app-settings:\">Click here to open the Stickerboard settings menu</a>
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <br><h1>Allow full access</h1>
    <p>
        Stickerboard requires full access to function. Don't worry, we aren't uploading
        your stickers anywhere! All of your data stays on your device. Stickerboard only
        needs full access to copy stickers to your clipboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        To enable full access, open the Stickerboard settings (in the same place you enabled
        the keyboard, see section above), and toggle the switch labeled \"Allow Full Access\".
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <br><h1>Add some stickers</h1>
    <p>
        You might have noticed that Stickerboard does not come with any stickers. That's
        because <i>you</i> provide them! Stickerboard allows you to send any image you want
        as a sticker. Once you've added the images, just hit the import button within the app
        and they will magically appear in the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        So how do you add images to Stickerboard? There are three ways to do this:
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <br><h1>1. Share menu</h1>
    <p>
        Have some images on your device you would like to use? Hit share, then select
        the \"Save to Files\" option. When given the option, choose Stickerboard under
        \"On My iPhone\".
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <br><h1>2. iTunes File Sharing</h1>
    <p>
        Want to copy stickers from your computer? You can use iTunes File Sharing to
        drag and drop the images from your computer directly into the Stickerboard app.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <br><h1>3. Files app</h1>
    <p>
        You can use the built-in Files app to manage your stickers. Just copy the images
        you want to add to the Stickerboard folder under \"On My iPhone\".
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <br><h1>Sticker packs</h1>
    <p>
        Too many stickers to handle? Create new sticker packs by organizing your images
        into folders under the Stickerboard directory. Each folder will turn into a new
        sticker pack.
    </p>
